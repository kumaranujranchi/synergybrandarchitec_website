Task for AI Agent:

Create a New Page with the name "Addons" on the website.

The page should be added to the navigation menu for easy access.

Title: "Add-ons"

Content: A short introduction about the add-on services for clients who have already had their websites developed by the agency.

Example text: "Explore our additional services that can be added to your existing website. Choose the service you want, and our team will contact you to complete the task."

List of Services to Add on the Page:

Create a well-structured table or grid format to display the services with the following details:

Service Name:

Example: "Addition of Page"

Price:

Example: "1000 Rs"

Description:

Example: "For clients who have had their website built by us. Add an extra page to your existing website."

Add to Cart Button: Each service will have a button or clickable element that will allow the user to add the service to their cart. The cart functionality should be simple and easy to use.

User Registration & Login:

Implement mandatory user registration to allow clients to track their orders.

After registration, users should be able to log in and view:

Their order history.

The status of each order (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Completed).

Ability to request revisions or changes for completed tasks.

Implement a "Forgot Password" functionality for users.

Cart Option:

Add a cart option on the same page that users can use to review and select the services they want.

The cart should display the name of the service, the price, and a total amount at the bottom.

Users should be able to add or remove services from their cart.

Once services are selected, users should be able to click a "Proceed to Checkout" button.

Checkout Process:

After clicking "Proceed to Checkout," users should be prompted to provide the following details:

Full Name

Email Address

Phone Number

Message (Optional)

Payment Page: Integrate a payment gateway API (such as Razorpay, Stripe, or PayPal) to allow users to make direct payments for the services.

After successful payment, users should receive a payment confirmation email.

Admin Panel Functionality:

View Orders: Admin should have a section to view all current orders, including order details, user information, and the services selected.

Order Status: Admin can mark an order as "In Progress" or "Completed" once the task is done. Completed orders will be visible to the customer, who can request revisions or changes.

Add/Remove Services: Admin should have the ability to add new services, remove existing services, and edit the pricing of any service.

Service Management: The admin should be able to manage all the services in a structured way (similar to an e-commerce platformâ€™s product catalog).

Backend Process:

Order Management: When a user submits the checkout form, the system should store the order details, payment status, and customer details in the admin panel for review and processing.

Admin will then schedule a meeting with the client to understand the requirements in detail.

After the meeting, the admin will mark the task as "In Progress" or "Completed".

When the order is marked as completed, the customer can request revisions or changes through their login account.

Notifications:

Send a confirmation email to the customer after placing an order and making payment.

Send an email to the admin when a new order is placed, containing the order details and payment information.

Test the Process:

Verify that the entire process, including order submission, payment processing, order tracking, and admin panel management, is functioning smoothly without any issues.

Test the user registration/login, cart system, and admin panel controls.

Ensure that the page is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
